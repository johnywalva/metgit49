>show dbs

to create a new database:
> use cdac
== switched to database cdac
* if database does not exist it will create.
* if alreay exist it will connect to it.

to see your currently selected database:- 
>db
> show dbs
local 0.000GB
* we created cdac database but it doesn't show in the list. 
  You should have atleast one collection in that database.

to see list of collections :-
>show collections

to drop database:-
>db.dropDatabase()
* this is case sensitive i.e. camel case
* this will drop currently selected database.
  if you have not selected any database it will drop "test" database.

to create a collection:- 

>db.createCollection("library")
>show collections
>show dbs

to drop the collection:-
>db.library.drop()

to insert a document in the library collection :-

>db.COLLECTION_NAME.insert(document)
>db.library.insert({title:'MongoDB programming',author:'Sameer',likes:100})

to view the data you have to use the find method:-
>db.COLLECTION_NAME.find()

>db.library.find()

Observe the _id field (similar to Primary Key)

insert another document :-
>db.library.insert({title:'MySQL programming',authors:['Jack','Jill'],likes:200})

to view it :-

>db.library.find()

to make it more presentable :-
>db.library.find().pretty()

we also have a findOne() method:-
>db.library.findOne()

Update document:-

>db.COLLECTION_NAME.update(SELECTION_CRITERIA, UPDATED_DATA)

Let me update the author name from 'Sameer' to 'Sameer Dehadrai'

db.library.update({author:'Sameer'},{$set:{'Sameer Dehadrai'}})

use the pretty method to vew it:-

>db.library.find().pretty()


Delete document:-
>db.COLLECTION_NAME.remove(DELETION_CRITERIA)

Let us delete a document that has 100 likes:-
>db.library.remove({likes:100})

>exit
==to come out from mongodb shell

to stop mongoDB database:-
press ctrl+C in terminal where the mongod instance is running.
